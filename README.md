  Uploaded AI_Exercise_V1.py, which Improved feature engineering in order to implement LSTM model on entire dataset(including all 28 venues) with multiple time steps.
  
  However, it only reduces the RMSE from roughly 9.8 to 9.2. I am still looking for a method to solve the uneven interval between dates.

Hi, welcome to my first project that uses LSTM.

Install requirements.txt file to make sure correct versions of libraries are being used. running on python 3.6.5.

AI_Exercise.py: returns the predicted tempurature on 2019-01-24 at Capital Center and saves the model as ./Model0.hdf5.
